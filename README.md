 The Connect 4 game is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid! Players choose "Player 1" or "Player 2" They drop the numbers ("1" for Player 1 and "2" for Player 2) into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their numbers upwards, horizontally, or diagonally.
